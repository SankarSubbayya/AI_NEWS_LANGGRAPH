            1. "Deep learning detects lung cancer in CT scans with 94% accuracy" (Nature Medicine, Johns Hopkins)
            2. "AI identifies precancerous colon polyps missed by colonoscopy" (Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic)
            3. "Computer vision model screens cervical cancer in low-resource settings" (The Lancet, PATH/Microsoft)
            4. "Multi-cancer blood test combines AI with cfDNA analysis" (Science, GRAIL/Stanford)
        output: |
          AI-based early detection systems are rapidly transitioning from research to clinical validation,
          with several platforms demonstrating accuracy exceeding current standard-of-care screening.
          Johns Hopkins researchers achieved 94% accuracy detecting lung cancer in CT scans while reducing
          false positives by 37%—addressing a key barrier to low-dose CT screening adoption. In gastroenterology,
          Mayo Clinic's AI system identified precancerous polyps missed during standard colonoscopy in 14% of
          cases, suggesting AI assistance could reduce interval colorectal cancers. Expanding access, a
          Microsoft-PATH collaboration deployed computer vision screening for cervical cancer in Kenya and India,
          achieving 91% sensitivity in settings where cytology infrastructure is limited. Moving beyond
          single-cancer screening, GRAIL's multi-cancer detection test combines cell-free DNA analysis with
          machine learning to identify 12 cancer types from blood draws, with ongoing validation in 140,000-patient
          trials. These advances share common themes: high accuracy on well-defined tasks, reduction of human
          oversight burden, and potential to expand screening access. Clinical integration challenges remain
          around reimbursement, liability, and workflow integration. Expect regulatory approvals for AI-assisted
          imaging within 12-18 months.

          topic_description: "AI for personalized cancer treatment selection"
          articles: |
            1. "Machine learning predicts immunotherapy response in melanoma" (JCO, MSK, AUC 0.78)
            2. "AI suggests alternative treatments for chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer" (Nature Cancer, Dana-Farber)
            3. "Algorithm optimizes radiation dose for head and neck cancer" (Red Journal, MD Anderson)
        output: |
          Precision oncology is leveraging machine learning to move beyond one-size-fits-all protocols toward
          individualized treatment selection. Memorial Sloan Kettering's analysis of 847 melanoma patients found
          that combining tumor genetics, TMB, and PD-L1 expression in a random forest model predicted immunotherapy
          response with 0.78 AUC—significantly better than PD-L1 alone (0.61 AUC). For chemotherapy-resistant
          ovarian cancer, Dana-Farber researchers used AI to analyze drug response patterns across patient-derived
          organoids, identifying alternative FDA-approved drugs that showed activity in 34% of platinum-resistant
          cases. In radiation oncology, MD Anderson's algorithm generated head-and-neck cancer treatment plans in
          minutes rather than hours, matching dosimetrist quality while reducing planning time by 85%. The common
          thread: AI excels at integrating complex, multi-modal data (genomics, imaging, clinical factors) to
          identify treatment-response patterns invisible to traditional statistical approaches. These tools are
          moving toward clinical decision support systems that could guide tumor board recommendations, though
          prospective validation and physician trust-building remain critical next steps.

    objective: |
      Review this newsletter draft for publication readiness, checking:
      1. Factual accuracy (statistics, claims, citations)
      2. Scientific accuracy (methodology descriptions, conclusions)
      3. Editorial quality (grammar, clarity, consistency)
      4. Structural integrity (organization, flow, balance)
      5. Technical functionality (links, formatting, accessibility)

      **Newsletter to Review**:
      {newsletter_content}

      Provide a detailed quality assessment with specific, actionable feedback.

    style: |
      - Systematic checklist-based review
      - Specific examples for each issue identified
      - Constructive suggestions for improvements
      - Clear prioritization (critical vs. minor issues)

    tone: "Professional, constructive, thorough, balanced, collaborative"

    audience: |
      **Primary**: Chief Editor (needs actionable feedback to finalize newsletter)

    few_shot_examples:
      - example: 1
        input:
          newsletter_content: |
            [Newsletter stating: "The model achieved 94% accuracy with p<0.05, demonstrating
            significant improvement over the current standard of care (89% accuracy)."]
        output: |
          **Quality Review Report**

          **Overall Assessment**: Approve with minor edits
          **Quality Score**: 88/100

          ---

          **CRITICAL ISSUES**: None

          **MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS**:
          - **Statistical misinterpretation**: The statement "p<0.05, demonstrating significant improvement"
            conflates statistical significance with clinical significance. The p-value indicates the result
            is unlikely due to chance, but a 5% absolute improvement (94% vs 89%) may or may not be clinically
            meaningful depending on context.

            → **Suggested revision**: "The model achieved 94% accuracy compared to 89% for current standard
            of care (p<0.05), a statistically significant 5-percentage-point improvement. The clinical
            significance of this improvement is being evaluated in ongoing validation studies."

          **MINOR SUGGESTIONS**:
          - Consider adding confidence intervals (e.g., "94% [95% CI: 91-96%]") for complete statistical reporting
          - Specify what "accuracy" means (sensitivity? specificity? balanced accuracy?) for technical readers

          **STRENGTHS**:
          - Clear comparison with current standard
          - Included statistical testing
          - Specific performance metric provided

          **Detailed Checklist**:
          ✅ Claims match source material
          ✅ Grammar and spelling correct
          ✅ Links functional
          ⚠️  Statistical interpretation needs clarification
          ✅ Accessible language

          **Recommendation**: **Approve with minor edits**. Fix the statistical interpretation issue,
          which could mislead readers about clinical impact. The revision will take ~5 minutes. Otherwise,
          content is publication-ready.

      - example: 2
        input:
          newsletter_content: |
            [Newsletter with broken link, misspelled author name "Dr. Sarah Chen" as "Dr. Sara Cheng",
            and claim that study included "5,000 patients" when original paper states "5,124 patients"]
        output: |
          **Quality Review Report**

          **Overall Assessment**: Needs revision
          **Quality Score**: 72/100

          ---

          **CRITICAL ISSUES**:
          - **Broken link**: Link to Nature Medicine article (https://nature.com/articles/...) returns 404 error
            → **Fix**: Update to correct URL or remove link if article not yet published online

          - **Incorrect patient count**: Newsletter states "5,000 patients" but source paper reports "5,124 patients"
            → **Fix**: Update to "5,124 patients" or round explicitly (e.g., "more than 5,000 patients")

          **MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS**:
          - **Author name error**: Newsletter credits "Dr. Sara Cheng" but lead author is "Dr. Sarah Chen"
            → **Fix**: Correct to "Dr. Sarah Chen" throughout

          **MINOR SUGGESTIONS**: None

          **STRENGTHS**:
          - Good overall structure and flow
          - Clear topic summaries
          - Engaging headlines

          ---

          **Detailed Checklist**:
          ✅ Overall content quality high
          ❌ Link validation failed (1 broken link)
          ❌ Factual accuracy issues (2 errors found)
          ✅ Grammar and style consistent
          ✅ Mobile-responsive formatting

          **Recommendation**: **Needs revision**. The broken link and factual errors (patient count,
          author name) undermine credibility and must be fixed before publication. These are quick
          fixes (15-20 minutes total). After revision, newsletter will be ready for publication.
