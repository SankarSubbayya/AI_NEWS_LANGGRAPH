# 🎯 How to Switch from Sample to Full AI Workflow

## 🔍 THE ISSUE:

You're currently seeing **sample data** instead of real articles because the default mode is:
```
Generation Mode: "Quick (Sample Data)" ← Currently selected
```

---

## ✅ HOW TO FIX (30 seconds):

### Step 1: Open Streamlit
```
http://localhost:8502
```

### Step 2: Look at LEFT SIDEBAR

Find this section:
```
🔬 Generation Mode
⚪ Quick (Sample Data) ← DON'T use this!
⚪ Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive) ← SELECT THIS! ⭐
```

### Step 3: Click "Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive)"

You'll see a warning:
```
⚠️ Full workflow uses: Research Agent, Summarizer, Editor, 
Quality Reviewer + COSTAR prompts. Takes 2-5 minutes.
```

**That's correct!** This is what you want.

### Step 4: Verify Your Settings

Make sure you have:

```
📊 Data Source:
⚫ Config File Topics (Real) ← Should be selected ✅

🔬 Generation Mode:  
⚫ Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive) ← Should be selected ✅

🔑 API Configuration:
✅ API key loaded from environment (or enter your key)
```

### Step 5: Generate Newsletter

Click **"🚀 Generate Newsletter"**

**Wait 2-5 minutes** for:
- ✅ Research Agent to fetch 50 articles
- ✅ Summarizer Agent to analyze them
- ✅ Editor Agent to create summary
- ✅ Quality Reviewer to score everything

## 💡 PRO TIP:

### To Always Use Full Workflow:

The sidebar setting persists during your session. Once you select "Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive)", it stays selected until you change it or refresh the page.

### To Make It Default:

You can change the default in the code (line 249 of `streamlit_newsletter_app.py`):

```python
# Current (Quick is default)
index=0  # "Quick (Sample Data)"

# Change to (Full is default)
index=1  # "Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive)"
```

But for now, just **select it manually in the sidebar**!
