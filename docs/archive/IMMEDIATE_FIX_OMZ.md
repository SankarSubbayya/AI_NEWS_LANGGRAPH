# ⚡ IMMEDIATE FIX - Oh-My-Zsh "ource" Error

## 🎯 THE ISSUE:

You see this error **immediately after** oh-my-zsh loads:
```
[oh-my-zsh] You can update manually by running `omz upda
ource /Users/sankar/.../AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH/.venv/bin/activate
zsh: command not found: ource
```

---

## ✅ QUICK FIX (30 seconds):

### Option 1: One-Liner Fix

```bash
# Copy-paste this entire command:
cp ~/.zsh_history ~/.zsh_history.backup && sed -i '' '/ource/d' ~/.zsh_history && echo 'function ource() { source "$@"; }' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc && echo "✅ Fixed! Now restart terminal."
```

Then **close and reopen your terminal**.

### Option 2: Use the Script

```bash
cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH
./fix_oh_my_zsh.sh
```

Then **restart your terminal**.

---

## 🔍 WHY THIS HAPPENS:

The typo `ource` is in your shell history file (`~/.zsh_history`), and something is trying to re-execute it when the shell starts.

**Possible causes:**
1. **zsh auto-correction** trying to suggest/run the last similar command
2. **zoxide plugin** interacting with history
3. **Shell history expansion** being triggered
4. **Terminal profile** with a startup command

---

## 📋 MANUAL STEP-BY-STEP:

If you prefer to do it manually:

```bash
# Step 1: Backup history
cp ~/.zsh_history ~/.zsh_history.backup
echo "✅ Backed up"

# Step 2: Remove ALL lines with 'ource' typo
sed -i '' '/ource/d' ~/.zsh_history
echo "✅ Cleaned history"

# Step 3: Add safety function (optional but recommended)
cat >> ~/.zshrc << 'EOF'

# Auto-fix 'ource' typo
function ource() {
    source "$@"
}
EOF
echo "✅ Added safety function"

# Step 4: Reload
source ~/.zshrc
echo "✅ Reloaded config"

# Step 5: RESTART TERMINAL (important!)
echo "🔄 Now close and reopen terminal"
```

---

## 🛡️ PREVENTION FOR FUTURE:

### Add Helpful Aliases

Instead of manually activating venv, use aliases:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc:
cat >> ~/.zshrc << 'ALIASES'

# AI News Project shortcuts
alias ai="cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH && source .venv/bin/activate"
alias ai-run="cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH && source .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run streamlit_newsletter_app.py"
ALIASES

source ~/.zshrc
```

Now just type:
- `ai` → Activate project
- `ai-run` → Start Streamlit

---

## 🔧 IF ERROR STILL PERSISTS:

### Check Terminal Settings

**iTerm2:**
```
1. iTerm2 → Preferences (⌘,)
2. Profiles → General → Send text at start
3. Remove any command
```

**Terminal.app:**
```
1. Terminal → Preferences
2. Profiles → Shell → Startup
3. Uncheck "Run command" or clear it
```

### Debug Mode

To see exactly what's executing:

```bash
# Add to top of ~/.zshrc (temporarily)
set -x  # Enable debug mode

# Restart terminal
# You'll see every command that executes
# Find the 'ource' command in the output

# Remove debug mode after finding the issue:
# Edit ~/.zshrc and remove 'set -x'
```

### Nuclear Option

If nothing works, temporarily disable oh-my-zsh:

```bash
# Rename your .zshrc
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup

# Start fresh
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc

# Edit to add back only essentials:
nano ~/.zshrc
# - Set your theme
# - Add your plugins: plugins=(git)
# - Add your aliases

# Restart terminal
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION:

After the fix, when you open a new terminal, you should see:

```
✅ GOOD:
[oh-my-zsh] You can update manually by running `omz update`
~ %

❌ BAD (what you see now):
[oh-my-zsh] You can update manually by running `omz update`
ource /Users/sankar/.../AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH/.venv/bin/activate
zsh: command not found: ource
~ %
```

---

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The command is in line **1760859075** of your history:
```
: 1760859075:0;ource /Users/sankar/.../AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH/.venv/bin/activate
```

This gets triggered because:
1. You have zoxide plugin enabled
2. Zoxide initializes: `eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"`
3. This might trigger history loading/execution
4. The typo command runs
5. Error appears

**Solution:** Remove from history + add safety function

---

## 💡 BETTER WORKFLOW:

### Auto-activate venv with direnv

```bash
# Install direnv
brew install direnv

# Add to ~/.zshrc (before oh-my-zsh loads):
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"

# In your project:
cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH
echo 'source .venv/bin/activate' > .envrc
direnv allow

# Now it auto-activates when you cd into the directory!
```

## 📊 SUMMARY:

| What | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Problem** | ❌ Typo in history | Remove it |
| **Location** | `~/.zsh_history` | Clean file |
| **Trigger** | oh-my-zsh load | Fixed by cleaning |
| **Prevention** | Use aliases | Add to ~/.zshrc |

---

## 🚀 ACTION PLAN:

```bash
# 1. Run the fix
cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH
./fix_oh_my_zsh.sh

# 2. Close ALL terminals

# 3. Open new terminal

# 4. Verify - should see NO error!

# 5. Add helpful alias:
echo "alias ai='cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH && source .venv/bin/activate'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# 6. Test:
ai  # Should activate your project!
```

**Run `./fix_oh_my_zsh.sh` now, then restart your terminal!** 🎉
