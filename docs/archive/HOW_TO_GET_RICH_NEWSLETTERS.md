- ✅ **25+ sources** (ScienceDirect, PubMed, Nature)

## 🚀 FIXED! Here's How to Get Rich Newsletters:

### **I Just Added "Full AI Workflow" Mode to Streamlit!** 🎉

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE

### Step 1: Open Streamlit (Already Running!)
```
Streamlit is starting...
The app should open in your browser automatically.
If not, go to: http://localhost:8501

### Step 2: Configure the Sidebar

**Look at the LEFT sidebar** and select:

1. **🎯 Generation Mode:**
   ```

   ⚫ Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive) ← SELECT THIS! ⭐
   ```

2. **📁 Data Source:**
   ```
   Config File Topics (Real) ← SELECT THIS!
   ```
   This loads your 5 topics from `topics_cancer.json`:
   - Diagnostic Techniques
   - Treatment Development
   - Personalized Medicine
   - Early Detection
   - Ethical Implications

3. **🔑 OpenAI API Key:**
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar
   - OR set it in `.env` file:
     ```bash
     echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" >> .env
     ```

### Step 3: Generate Newsletter
1. Click the big **"Generate Newsletter"** button
2. Watch the progress bar (shows which agent is working)
3. Wait **2-5 minutes** (it's doing real research!)

### Step 4: Enjoy Your Rich Newsletter! 🎊

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Full AI Workflow option not appearing"
```bash
# The import was just fixed! Restart Streamlit:
lsof -ti:8501 | while read pid; do kill -9 $pid; done
streamlit run streamlit_newsletter_app.py
```

### "Invalid OpenAI API Key"
```bash
# Set in .env file:
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env

# Or enter in Streamlit sidebar (left panel)
```

### "No articles found"
```bash
# Make sure you selected:
# - Generation Mode: "Full AI Workflow (Comprehensive)"
# - Data Source: "Config File Topics (Real)"
```

### "Generation is taking too long"
```
This is NORMAL! Real research takes time:
- Research Agent: 30-60 seconds
- Summarizer: 60-90 seconds
- Editor: 30-60 seconds
- Quality Review: 20-30 seconds
Total: 2-5 minutes is expected
```

## 📁 WHERE ARE THE RICH NEWSLETTERS SAVED?

```bash
outputs/newsletters/streamlit_newsletter_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html
```

**Old rich newsletters (run.py):**
```bash
outputs/newsletter_20251015_105030.html  ← Your reference!
```

**New rich newsletters (Streamlit Full Workflow):**
```bash
outputs/newsletters/streamlit_newsletter_20251019_HHMMSS.html  ← New!
```

---

## 🔄 ALTERNATIVE: Use run.py (Command Line)

If you prefer the command line:

```bash
# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run workflow (same quality as Full Workflow mode)
python run.py

# Newsletter saved to:
# outputs/newsletter_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html
```

This produces the **exact same rich content** as the Streamlit "Full AI Workflow" mode!
