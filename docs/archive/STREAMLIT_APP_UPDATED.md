## 🔧 Technical Details

### What the App Does Now:

**File Loaded:**
```python
src/ai_news_langgraph/config/topics_cancer.json
```

**Topics Extracted:**
```json
{
  "main_topic": "Artificial Intelligence in Cancer Care",
  "sub_topics": [
    { "name": "Cancer Research", ... },
    { "name": "Cancer Prevention", ... },
    { "name": "Early Detection and Diagnosis", ... },
    { "name": "Treatment Planning", ... },
    { "name": "Clinical Trials", ... }
  ]
}
```

**Newsletter Generated:**
- 5 topics (not 3!)
- Each with description from config
- Each with 4 sample findings
- Knowledge graph analyzes all 5 topics
- Glossary includes terms from all 5 topics

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Current Behavior:
The app currently uses **sample content** for key findings because:
- It's a quick UI demonstration
- Real news fetching requires the full LangGraph workflow
- That workflow takes longer (fetching from web, API calls, etc.)

### To Get Real News Articles:

**Option 1: Run Full Workflow (Command Line)**
```bash
python run.py
```
This fetches real news for all 5 topics from the web.

**Option 2: Integrate LangGraph into Streamlit (Future Enhancement)**
Add a "Fetch Real News" button that:
- Runs the full LangGraph workflow
- Fetches actual articles from web
- Summarizes them with AI
- Generates newsletter with real data
