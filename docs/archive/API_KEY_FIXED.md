# ✅ API KEY ISSUE FIXED!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

3. **Created Templates** - `env.template` and helper scripts

## 🚀 STREAMLIT IS RESTARTING...

**Once it opens, you'll see a NEW API key section in the sidebar!**

Expected URL: **http://localhost:8502**

---

## 🎯 THREE WAYS TO SET YOUR API KEY (Now All Working!)

### ⭐ OPTION 1: Streamlit UI (EASIEST!)

**NEW! This is now available:**

1. Open http://localhost:8502
2. Look at the **LEFT SIDEBAR**
3. You'll see **"🔑 API Configuration"** at the top
4. If no key is found, you'll see an input field
5. Paste your key: `sk-proj-...`
6. Click outside the field
7. ✅ Key is set! App will refresh automatically

**Status Indicators:**
- ✅ Green: "API key loaded from environment"
- ⚠️ Yellow: "No API key found" (shows input field)

---

### 📝 OPTION 2: .env File (PERMANENT!)

**Create `.env` file from template:**

```bash
cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH

# Copy template
cp env.template .env

# Edit with your key (replace YOUR-KEY with actual key)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR-KEY-HERE" > .env

# Restart Streamlit (it will reload automatically)
```

**Or use the interactive script:**

```bash
./create_env.sh
# Follow the prompts
```

---

### 💻 OPTION 3: Terminal Export (SESSION ONLY)

```bash
# Set for current terminal session
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-proj-your-actual-key-here'

# Verify it's set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Restart Streamlit (in same terminal)
cd /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH
streamlit run streamlit_newsletter_app.py
```

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Still showing 'No API key found'"

**If you entered key in UI:**
- Make sure you clicked outside the input field
- Check if app refreshed
- Try entering again

**If you created .env file:**
```bash
# Verify .env exists and has the key
cat /Users/sankar/sankar/courses/agentic-ai/sv-agentic-ai/AI_NEWS_LANGGRAPH/.env

# Should show:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Restart Streamlit
lsof -ti:8502 | while read pid; do kill -9 $pid; done
streamlit run streamlit_newsletter_app.py
```

### "API key not working / Invalid API key"

```bash
# Test your key directly
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
python -c "import openai; print(openai.api_key)"

# Get your key from:
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### "Can't find the API Configuration section"

```
Streamlit should have restarted with the fix.
If sidebar doesn't show "🔑 API Configuration":
1. Refresh your browser (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
2. Or force reload (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check you're on http://localhost:8502
```
