# üìù How to Create Enhanced COSTAR Prompts

## Overview

This guide explains how to create enhanced COSTAR prompts like `prompts_costar_enhanced.yaml`.

---

## What is COSTAR?

**CO-STAR** is a prompt engineering framework:

- **C**ontext: Background information and expertise
- **O**bjective: Specific task to accomplish
- **S**tyle: Writing style and format
- **T**one: Emotional quality and professionalism
- **A**udience: Target readers and expertise level
- **R**esponse: Expected output format

---

## Standard vs Enhanced COSTAR

### Standard COSTAR (`prompts_costar.yaml`)

```yaml
research_agent:
  analyze_relevance:
    context: "You are an expert AI research analyst."
    objective: "Evaluate article relevance to {topic_name}."
    style: "Analytical and evidence-based"
    tone: "Professional, objective"
    audience: "Medical oncologists and researchers"
    response: "Provide a relevance score from 0.0 to 1.0"
```

**Pros:** Simple, fast, lower cost  
**Cons:** Less consistent, generic guidance

### Enhanced COSTAR (`prompts_costar_enhanced.yaml`)

```yaml
research_agent:
  analyze_relevance:
    description: "Detailed task description"

## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Enhanced Prompts

### Step 1: Define the Task

Start with the basic task description:

```yaml
agent_name:
  task_name:
    description: "Brief description of what this prompt does"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
sentiment_analyzer:
  analyze_clinical_sentiment:
    description: "Analyze sentiment in patient reviews of cancer treatments"
```

### Step 2: Create a Detailed Persona (Context)

**Template:**
```yaml
context: |
  You are [Full Name], a [Job Title] at [Institution/Company] with:
  - [Education/Credential 1]
  - [Years] years of experience in [Domain]
  - [Achievement/Publication count]
  - [Special expertise or recognition]
  
  Your role is to [specific purpose that motivates the task].
  You specialize in [key skill or domain knowledge].
```

**Example:**
```yaml
context: |
  You are Dr. Emily Rodriguez, a Clinical Psychologist and Patient Experience
  Researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with:
  - Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology (Columbia, 2015)
  - 9 years studying patient-reported outcomes in oncology
  - Creator of the "Cancer Care Sentiment Scale" used in 200+ hospitals
  - Trained 500+ oncology teams on interpreting patient feedback
  
  Your role is to understand patients' emotional and practical experiences
  with cancer treatments, identifying both what works well and where care
  delivery can be improved.
```

### Step 3: Write a Detailed Objective

**Template:**
```yaml
objective: |
  [Action verb] the [thing to analyze] for [purpose].
  
  **Input Data**:
  [Field 1]: {variable1}
  [Field 2]: {variable2}
  
  [Additional context about what to focus on or consider]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
objective: |
  Analyze the sentiment expressed in this patient review of their cancer
  treatment experience. Identify the emotional tone, specific concerns,
  and satisfaction drivers.
  
  **Patient Review**:
  Treatment: {treatment_name}
  Cancer Type: {cancer_type}
  Review Text: {review_text}
  Date: {review_date}
  
  Focus on both medical aspects (efficacy, side effects) and care delivery
  aspects (communication, support, coordination).
```

### Step 4: Define Style Guidelines

**Template:**
```yaml
style: |
  - [Specific writing characteristic 1]
  - [Specific writing characteristic 2]
  - [Specific writing characteristic 3]
  - [What to emphasize or prioritize]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
style: |
  - Empathetic and patient-centered language
  - Evidence-based analysis citing specific phrases from review
  - Balanced assessment of positive and negative sentiments
  - Action-oriented focus on what clinicians can learn
```

### Step 5: Specify Tone

**Template:**
```yaml
tone: "[Adjective 1], [Adjective 2], [Adjective 3], [Adjective 4]"
```

**Examples:**
- Medical research: `"Professional, scholarly, objective, precise"`
- Patient communication: `"Compassionate, accessible, reassuring, clear"`
- Technical analysis: `"Analytical, systematic, rigorous, detailed"`
- Executive summary: `"Concise, strategic, data-driven, actionable"`

### Step 6: Define Audience

**Template:**
```yaml
audience: |
  **Primary**: [Main audience with roles]
  **Secondary**: [Secondary audience]
  
  **Expertise Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced] - [what they know]
  **Reading Context**: [When/where they'll read this]
  **Information Need**: [What decision or action they need to make]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
audience: |
  **Primary**: Oncology nurses, patient navigators, care coordinators
  **Secondary**: Oncologists, quality improvement teams
  
  **Expertise Level**: Clinical professionals (knows cancer care, not psychology)
  **Reading Context**: Weekly care team meetings reviewing patient feedback
  **Information Need**: "How can we improve this patient's experience?"
```

### Step 7: Create Response Format with Rubric

**Template:**
```yaml
response_format: |
  Use this exact structure:
  
  **[Section 1 Name]**: [What to include]
  **[Section 2 Name]**: [What to include]
  **[Section 3 Name]**: [What to include]
  
  **Scoring/Evaluation Criteria** (if applicable):
  - [Criterion 1] ([Weight]%): [Description]
  - [Criterion 2] ([Weight]%): [Description]
  - [Criterion 3] ([Weight]%): [Description]
  
  **Output Format**: [Exact format specification]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
response_format: |
  Use this exact structure:
  
  **Overall Sentiment**: [Positive/Mixed/Negative]
  **Sentiment Score**: [0.0 to 1.0, where 0=very negative, 1=very positive]
  **Emotional Tone**: [Primary emotions detected]
  **Key Themes**: [3-5 main topics discussed]
  **Specific Concerns**: [List patient's concerns or complaints]
  **Positive Highlights**: [What patient appreciated]
  **Actionable Insights**: [What care team should consider]
  
  **Scoring Rubric**:
  - Language positivity (40%): Positive vs negative words
  - Treatment outcomes (30%): Satisfaction with medical results
  - Care experience (30%): Quality of interactions and support
  
  **Output Format**: Structured text with clear sections
```

### Step 8: Add Few-Shot Examples

**Template:**
```yaml
few_shot_examples:
  - example: 1
    input:
      variable1: "value"
      variable2: "value"
    output: |
      [Expected output in exact response format]
    reasoning: |
      [Optional: explain why this output is correct]
  
  - example: 2
    input:
      variable1: "different value"
      variable2: "different value"
    output: |
      [Expected output]
    reasoning: |
      [Explanation]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
few_shot_examples:
  - example: 1
    input:
      treatment_name: "Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) immunotherapy"
      cancer_type: "Stage III melanoma"
      review_text: "The immunotherapy worked amazingly well - my tumors shrank by 80% after just 3 cycles. However, the side effects were really tough. I developed severe colitis and had to be hospitalized twice. The oncology team was fantastic though, always available and explained everything clearly."
      review_date: "2024-03-15"
    output: |
      **Overall Sentiment**: Mixed
      **Sentiment Score**: 0.65
      **Emotional Tone**: Grateful but struggling; hopeful yet challenged
      **Key Themes**: Treatment efficacy, severe side effects, excellent care team
      **Specific Concerns**:
      - Severe colitis requiring hospitalization (2x)
      - Difficulty managing immunotherapy side effects
      **Positive Highlights**:
      - 80% tumor reduction after 3 cycles
      - "Fantastic" oncology team
      - Clear communication and availability
      **Actionable Insights**:
      - Consider proactive GI monitoring for immunotherapy patients
      - Highlight this case as example of good care team communication
      - Explore earlier intervention strategies for immune-related adverse events
    reasoning: |
      Mixed sentiment (0.65) reflects strong positive medical outcomes balanced
      by significant side effect challenges. High marks for care team suggest
      excellent support during difficulties. Focus on learning from both the
      clinical complications and the successful patient-provider relationship.
  
  - example: 2
    input:
      treatment_name: "FOLFOX chemotherapy"
      cancer_type: "Stage II colon cancer"
      review_text: "The worst experience of my life. No one told me the neuropathy would be this bad. I can't feel my hands or feet anymore. When I called the nurse line, they just said it was normal. I wish someone had prepared me for this."
      review_date: "2024-02-20"
    output: |
      **Overall Sentiment**: Negative
      **Sentiment Score**: 0.15
      **Emotional Tone**: Frustrated, disappointed, feeling abandoned
      **Key Themes**: Severe neuropathy, lack of preparation, inadequate response
      **Specific Concerns**:
      - Severe peripheral neuropathy (hands and feet)
      - Inadequate education about side effects
      - Dismissive response from nurse line
      - Feeling unprepared and unsupported
      **Positive Highlights**: None mentioned
      **Actionable Insights**:
      - **URGENT**: Improve pre-treatment counseling about neuropathy risk
      - Retrain nurse line staff on responding to neuropathy concerns
      - Consider earlier neuropathy screening and dose modifications
      - Reach out to this patient for care recovery conversation
    reasoning: |
      Highly negative sentiment (0.15) driven by both severe symptoms and
      perceived lack of support. The phrase "no one told me" signals a critical
      gap in patient education. Dismissive response from nurse line compounds
      the problem. This requires immediate quality improvement attention.
```

### Step 9: List Variables

```yaml
variables:
  - variable1
  - variable2
  - variable3
```

## Tips for Great Enhanced Prompts

### ‚úÖ Do

1. **Create believable personas** with specific credentials
2. **Include 2-3 few-shot examples** showing edge cases
3. **Use explicit scoring rubrics** with percentages
4. **Specify output format exactly** with examples
5. **Test iteratively** and refine based on results
6. **Add context about why** the task matters
7. **Include both positive and negative examples**

### ‚ùå Don't

1. **Be too generic** - "You are an expert" isn't enough
2. **Skip few-shot examples** - they dramatically improve consistency
3. **Use vague criteria** - "Good quality" is unclear
4. **Forget edge cases** - show what to do when data is ambiguous
5. **Make it too long** - 500-800 lines is the sweet spot
6. **Ignore token cost** - longer prompts cost more per API call

## Quality Benchmarks

| Prompt Type | Quality Score | Consistency | Cost |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Basic | 60-70% | Low | $ |
| Standard COSTAR | 75-80% | Medium | $$ |
| Enhanced COSTAR | 85-95% | High | $$$ |

---

## Testing Your Enhanced Prompts

### 1. Create Test Cases

```python
test_cases = [
    {
        "input": {"variable": "value"},
        "expected_score_range": (0.8, 0.9)
    },
    # Add 10-20 test cases
]
```

### 2. Run Comparison

```python
# Test standard vs enhanced
standard_results = run_with_prompt("prompts_costar.yaml")
enhanced_results = run_with_prompt("prompts_costar_enhanced.yaml")

# Compare quality scores
print(f"Standard: {np.mean(standard_results):.2f}")
print(f"Enhanced: {np.mean(enhanced_results):.2f}")
```

### 3. Measure Consistency

```python
# Run same input 10 times
scores = [run_prompt(test_input) for _ in range(10)]
std_dev = np.std(scores)

# Lower std dev = more consistent
print(f"Consistency (std dev): {std_dev:.3f}")
```
