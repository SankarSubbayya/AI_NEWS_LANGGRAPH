# ⚡ ERROR FIXED - Quick Summary

## 🔴 YOUR ERROR:

```
WARNING - Failed to generate knowledge graph/glossary: 
'CancerResearchKnowledgeGraph' object has no attribute 'add_document'
```

---

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED:

The code in `nodes_v2.py` was calling methods that **don't exist**:

```python
# ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN):
kg_builder.export_graphml(kg_graphml_path)          # Method doesn't exist!
kg_builder.export_interactive_html(kg_html_path)    # Method doesn't exist!
```

**I changed it to:**

```python
# ✅ AFTER (FIXED):
kg_builder.export_to_json(kg_json_path)  # This method exists!
```

---

## ✅ STATUS: FIXED!

**File Changed:** `src/ai_news_langgraph/nodes_v2.py` (lines 727-744)

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Removed calls to `export_graphml()` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ Removed calls to `export_interactive_html()` (doesn't exist)  
- ✅ Now uses `export_to_json()` (exists!)

---

## 🧪 VERIFICATION:

```bash
$ python test_nodes_kg_fix.py
```

**Result:**
```
✅ SUCCESS: 12 entities, 21 relationships
✅ SUCCESS: Exported to outputs/knowledge_graphs/test_kg.json
✅ File exists: 5879 bytes

✅ nodes_v2.py has been FIXED to use the correct methods!
