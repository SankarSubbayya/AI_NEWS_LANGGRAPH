# AI-Powered Glossary Enhancement

## Summary

**Yes, the knowledge graph IS being used to generate glossaries!** And now with AI-powered definitions instead of placeholder text.

## What Changed

### Before (Placeholder Definitions)
```python
glossary_entries.append({
    'term': entity,
    'definition': f"A {entity_type.replace('_', ' ')} term in cancer research with AI applications.",
    # ^ Generic placeholder text
})
```

**Example output:**
- "Lung cancer" → "A cancer type term in cancer research with AI applications."
- "Immunotherapy" → "A treatment term in cancer research with AI applications."

### After (AI-Generated Definitions)
```python
# Use GlossaryGenerator to create AI-powered definitions
glossary_gen = GlossaryGenerator(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.3)

definition = glossary_gen._generate_definition(
    term=entity,
    related_terms=related_terms[:5],  # From knowledge graph
    context=f"{main_topic} - {entity_type}",
    frequency=len(contexts)
)
```

**Example output:**
- "Lung cancer" → "A common cancer type where artificial intelligence assists in early detection through imaging analysis, treatment planning optimization, and predictive modeling for patient outcomes."
- "Immunotherapy" → "A cancer treatment approach that uses the immune system to fight cancer, enhanced by AI for patient selection, response prediction, and combination therapy optimization."

## How It Works

### Knowledge Graph → Glossary Pipeline

```
1. Knowledge Graph Construction
   ↓
   [Cancer entities extracted: diseases, treatments, biomarkers, etc.]
   [Relationships built: treats, diagnoses, biomarker_for]
   [Contexts tracked: where each term appears]

2. Importance Scoring
   ↓
   [Calculate centrality: frequency × 0.4 + outgoing × 0.3 + incoming × 0.3]
   [Rank entities by importance]

3. Top 15 Terms Selected
   ↓
   [Select highest-scoring entities from knowledge graph]

4. AI Definition Generation (NEW!)
   ↓
   For each term:
   - Extract related terms from knowledge graph
   - Count contexts/frequency
   - Generate contextual definition using GPT-4o-mini
   - Include entity type and domain context

5. Glossary Output
   ↓
   [15 entries with AI-generated definitions, scores, relationships]
```

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
**[nodes_v2.py:828-881](src/ai_news_langgraph/nodes_v2.py#L828-L881)**

### Key Changes

1. **Import GlossaryGenerator** (already imported at line 797)
   ```python
   from .glossary_generator import GlossaryGenerator
   ```

2. **Initialize AI Generator**
   ```python
   glossary_gen = GlossaryGenerator(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.3)
   ```

3. **Extract Related Terms from Knowledge Graph**
   ```python
   related_terms = []
   if entity in kg_builder.graph:
       for targets in kg_builder.graph[entity].values():
           related_terms.extend(targets[:3])  # Top 3 per relationship
   ```

4. **Generate AI-Powered Definition**
   ```python
   definition = glossary_gen._generate_definition(
       term=entity,
       related_terms=related_terms[:5],
       context=f"{main_topic} - {entity_type.replace('_', ' ')}",
       frequency=len(contexts)
   )
   ```

5. **Enhanced Glossary Entry**
   ```python
   glossary_entries.append({
       'term': entity,
       'entity_type': entity_type,
       'importance_score': round(score, 2),  # Real centrality score
       'definition': definition,              # AI-generated!
       'related_terms': related_terms[:5],   # From knowledge graph
       'contexts': len(contexts)             # Frequency count
   })
   ```

## Glossary Entry Structure

### Complete Entry Example

```json
{
  "term": "Deep Learning",
  "entity_type": "technology",
  "importance_score": 2.45,
  "definition": "A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers to analyze medical imaging, predict treatment outcomes, and identify cancer biomarkers with high accuracy.",

### Fields Explained

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `term` | Knowledge Graph | Entity name extracted from newsletter |
| `entity_type` | Knowledge Graph | Category (cancer_type, treatment, technology, etc.) |
| `importance_score` | Knowledge Graph | Centrality score (frequency + relationships) |
| `definition` | **AI-Generated** ✨ | Contextual definition via GPT-4o-mini |
| `related_terms` | Knowledge Graph | Related entities (from relationships) |
| `contexts` | Knowledge Graph | Number of times term appears |

## AI Definition Prompt

The `GlossaryGenerator` uses this prompt:

```python
system_message = f"""You are a medical and AI terminology expert creating a glossary
for a newsletter about {context}.

Generate clear, concise definitions that:
1. Explain the term in the context of cancer research and AI
2. Are 1-2 sentences long
3. Are accessible to healthcare professionals and researchers
4. Focus on practical applications and relevance
5. Don't repeat the term in the definition"""

human_message = f"""Define the term: "{term}"

Related terms in this newsletter: {related_terms}
Context: {context}
Term frequency in content: {frequency}

Provide a clear, concise definition (1-2 sentences):"""
```

## Performance Impact

### Additional Time
- **Per definition**: ~1-2 seconds (GPT-4o-mini API call)
- **Total for 15 terms**: ~15-30 seconds

### Additional Cost
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini
- **Per definition**: ~$0.0001 (100 tokens input + 50 tokens output)
- **Total for 15 terms**: ~$0.0015 (less than 1 cent!)

### Total Newsletter Generation Time
- Before: ~60-90 seconds
- After: ~75-120 seconds (+15-30 seconds for glossary)
- **Impact**: Minimal (~20% increase for much better quality)

## Error Handling

### Graceful Fallback

If AI generation fails for a term:

```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to generate definition for '{entity}': {e}")
    # Fallback to basic definition
    glossary_entries.append({
        'term': entity,
        'definition': f"A {entity_type.replace('_', ' ')} term in cancer research...",
        # ^ Placeholder as backup
    })
```

**Result**: Glossary always completes, even if some definitions use placeholders.

## Comparison: Before vs After
