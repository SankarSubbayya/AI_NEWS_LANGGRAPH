# Topic-Specific Cover Image Generation - Update

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **ENHANCED**

---

## Problem

Cover images were **generic** and didn't reflect the actual newsletter topics and content.

**Before**: Basic prompt using only:
- ❌ First 200 characters of summary (too short)
- ❌ First 3 topic names (not detailed)
- ❌ No analysis of content themes
- ❌ No extraction of key findings

**Result**: Generic AI + healthcare images, not specific to newsletter content

---

## Solution

**Enhanced prompt generation** to create highly context-specific, topic-aware images.

**File**: [`cover_image_generator.py:79-187`](src/ai_news_langgraph/cover_image_generator.py#L79-L187)

---

## What's New

### 1. Medical Term Extraction

```python
# Scans summary for specific medical/AI terms
medical_terms = ['immunotherapy', 'genomics', 'imaging', 'diagnosis',
                'deep learning', 'neural network', 'biomarker', ...]

found_terms = [term for term in medical_terms if term in summary_lower]
# These terms get highlighted in the visual
```

**Example**: If summary mentions "immunotherapy" and "genomics", the image will emphasize those concepts.

---

### 2. All Topics Included

```python
# Before: Only first 3 topics
topics_str = ", ".join(topics[:3])

# After: All 5 topics
topics_detail = ", ".join(topics[:5])
```

**Impact**: Image reflects **Cancer Research, Prevention, Detection, Treatment, AND Clinical Trials** - not just first 3.

---

### 3. Topic-Based Visual Elements

```python
visual_elements = []
if 'detection' in topic or 'diagnosis' in topic:
    visual_elements.append("medical imaging scans, diagnostic visualization")
if 'treatment' in topic or 'therapy' in topic:
    visual_elements.append("treatment planning, therapeutic approaches")
if 'research' in topic:
    visual_elements.append("laboratory research, scientific discovery")
if 'prevention' in topic:
    visual_elements.append("preventive healthcare, risk assessment")
if 'trial' in topic:
    visual_elements.append("clinical trial data, patient outcomes")
```

**Result**: If your topics include "Early Detection" and "Treatment Planning", the image will show:
- Medical imaging scans
- Diagnostic visualization
- Treatment planning elements
- Therapeutic approaches

---

### 4. Quantitative Results

```python
# Extract percentages and numbers from summary
numbers = re.findall(r'\d+%|\d+\.?\d*\s*(?:percent|accuracy|improvement)',
                     executive_summary)

results_mention = f" with {numbers[0]}" if numbers else ""
# "AI in Cancer Care with 94% accuracy"
```

**Impact**: If summary mentions "94% accuracy", the image reflects high-precision, data-driven themes.

---

### 5. First Sentence Theme

```python
first_sentence = executive_summary.split('.')[0]
# Content Theme: "AI-based early detection systems are rapidly transitioning
#                 from research to clinical validation"
```

**Impact**: The overall image mood/composition reflects the main theme.

---

## Example Enhanced Prompt

### Input Data
